GOAL: Firewalls to protect web applications from web exploitation attacks
```

<h4> Web security risks 🌐 are still very much in their infancy 💻 . Most of websites are likely to be exposed to web exploitation attacks ❌ . For so, the focus of this project 💡 is to build firewalls to protect web applications from a variety of application layer attacks 🔏 such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and cookie poisoning</h4><br><br><br>


<h1 align='center'>🌐 Definition 🌐</h1>
<p align="center">A web application firewall is a security policy enforcement point positioned between a web application and the client endpoint. This functionality can be implemented in software or hardware, running in an appliance device, or in a typical server running a common operating system. It may be a stand-alone device or integrated into other network components</p><br>
