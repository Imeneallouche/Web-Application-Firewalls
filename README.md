GOAL: Firewalls to protect web applications from web exploitation attacks
```

<h3> Web security risks 🌐 are still very much in their infancy 💻 . Most of websites are likely to be exposed to web exploitation attacks ❌ . For so, the focus of this project 💡 is to build firewalls to protect web applications from a variety of application layer attacks 🔏 such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and cookie poisoning</h3>
